The 'more' command is a command-line utility in Unix-like operating systems that allows you to view the contents of a file or the output of a command in a paginated manner. It is often used to display long texts or files that don't fit on a single screen.

When you use the more command, it displays one page of text at a time. You can navigate through the text using keyboard commands. Here are some common commands available when using more:

Enter/Spacebar: Scroll down one line or one screenful.
B: Scroll up one screenful.
Q: Quit the more command.
**/: Search for a specific pattern in the text. Press "n" to find the next occurrence.
G: Go to the end of the text.
1G: Go to the beginning of the text.
H: Display a help screen with more commands.
