The cript html2php.sh is a specific application script used to convert HTML files, following a particular scheme, into PHP files. The conversion is achieved by removing the first 25 lines and the last 21 lines from each HTML file and replacing them with PHP tags that provide header and footer lines.

Let's break down the script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
# specific conversion script for my html files to php

LIST="$(ls *.html)"
for i in "$LIST"; do
     NEWNAME=$(ls "$i" | sed -e 's/html/php/')
     cat beginfile > "$NEWNAME"
     cat "$i" | sed -e '1,25d' | tac | sed -e '1,21d'| tac >> "$NEWNAME"
     cat endfile >> "$NEWNAME"
done
#!/bin/bash is known as the shebang and specifies the interpreter (Bash) to execute the script.

The comment # specific conversion script for my html files to php provides a brief description of the script's purpose.

LIST="$(ls *.html)" uses the ls command with a wildcard pattern *.html to generate a list of HTML files in the current directory and assigns it to the variable LIST.

The for loop iterates over each file in the LIST. The variable i holds the filename during each iteration.

NEWNAME=$(ls "$i" | sed -e 's/html/php/') uses the sed command to replace the file extension .html with .php in the filename stored in i. The modified name is assigned to the variable NEWNAME.

cat beginfile > "$NEWNAME" writes the contents of the file beginfile to the file specified by NEWNAME. This file acts as the PHP header.

cat "$i" | sed -e '1,25d' | tac | sed -e '1,21d' | tac >> "$NEWNAME" reads the content of the HTML file specified by i, removes the first 25 lines, reverses the remaining lines using tac, removes the first 21 lines of the reversed content, reverses the lines again using tac, and finally appends the modified content to the file specified by NEWNAME.

cat endfile >> "$NEWNAME" appends the contents of the file endfile to the file specified by NEWNAME. This file acts as the PHP footer.

The script performs the conversion for each HTML file in the directory, creating a corresponding PHP file with the modified content and the PHP header and footer lines added. The resulting PHP files are named the same as the original HTML files, but with the extension changed to .php.
