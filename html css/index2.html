        <h2>What constitutes INFJS</h2>
        <p>
            In a broader sense, an intuitive person tends to have a strong gut feeling or instinctive understanding of things, 
            enabling them to make quick and accurate judgments in various situations. Intuition often complements conscious 
            reasoning and can be valuable in decision-making processes, particularly in situations where time is limited or 
            complex information needs to be processed rapidly.
