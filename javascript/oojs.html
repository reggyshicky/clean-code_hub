<!--An object property can itself, eg trying to change the name member
to const person = {
    first: "Bob",
    last: "Smith",
} To access these items you need to chain the extra step onto the end with another dot
person.name.first , person.name.

BRACKET NOTATION
Bracket notation provides an alternative way to access object properties.
person.["age"];  person["name"]["first"];
Dot notation is generally preferred over bracket notation it is more succint and easier to read.
However there are some cases where you have to use brackets.For example, if an obj property name is held
in a variable, then you access the value using a bracket notation
