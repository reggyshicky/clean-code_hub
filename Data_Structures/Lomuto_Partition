Lomuto's partition scheme is a popular algorithm used in quicksort to partition an array into two parts based on a chosen pivot element. The algorithm is named after Nico Lomuto, who introduced it.

The Lomuto partition algorithm works as follows:

1. Choose a pivot element from the array. This pivot can be any element in the array, but for simplicity, let's assume the last element of the array is chosen as the pivot.
2. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`. `i` will be used to scan the array from left to right, while `j` will keep track of the boundary between elements less than or equal to the pivot and elements greater than the pivot.
3. Start iterating through the array from the beginning (index 0) until the second-to-last element (as the last element is the pivot).
   - If the current element is less than or equal to the pivot, swap it with the element at index `j` and increment `j`.
4. Once the iteration is complete, swap the pivot element (located at the last index) with the element at index `j`.
   - Now, all the elements to the left of index `j` are less than or equal to the pivot, and all the elements to the right of index `j` are greater than the pivot.
5. Return the index `j`, which represents the final position of the pivot after the partitioning.

Here's an example to illustrate the Lomuto partition algorithm:

Consider the array: [7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]

Choosing the last element, 4, as the pivot, we start the partitioning process:

1. Initialize `i = 0` and `j = 0`.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - i = 0: 7 > 4 (no swap)
   - i = 1: 2 <= 4 (swap 2 and 7, increment j to 1)
   - i = 2: 1 <= 4 (swap 1 and 7, increment j to 2)
   - i = 3: 6 > 4 (no swap)
   - i = 4: 8 > 4 (no swap)
   - i = 5: 5 > 4 (no swap)
   - i = 6: 3 <= 4 (swap 3 and 8, increment j to 3)
   - i = 7: 4 > 4 (no swap)
3. Swap the pivot (4) with the element at index `j` (3). The array becomes: [3, 2, 1, 4, 8, 5, 6, 7]
4. Return the final index of the pivot, which is 3.

After Lomuto partitioning, the elements to the left of index 3 (including index 3) are less than or equal to the pivot (4), and the elements to the right of index 3 are greater than the pivot.

This partitioning step is commonly used in the quicksort algorithm to recursively sort the array by applying the same process to the subarrays on both sides of the pivot.
